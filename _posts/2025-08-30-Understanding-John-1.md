John 1:1-18 says,

>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
>2 He was in the beginning with God.
>3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
>4 In him was life,and the life was the light of men.
>5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
>6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
>7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him.
>8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.
>9 The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
>10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.
>11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.
>12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,
>13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
>14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 
>15 (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) 
>16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.
>17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
>18 No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.
