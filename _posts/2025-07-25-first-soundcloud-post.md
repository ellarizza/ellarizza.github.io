Man, so much firsts tonight. I uploaded my first upload in SoundCloud (Let's gooooooo!). 
I was just playing around with REAPER. I downloaded a [free drum loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8kaPsEAbrE)
Recently, I realized I can directly record my piano using an audio interface. I played simple chord progression of Amazing Grace in F while the loop is playing. 
I enjoyed so much that I finished the whole loop. 

No mixing. Just recorded. And this is the [finish product](https://soundcloud.com/ella-fredeluces-26410287/20250725_jam_amazing_grace?si=3922f5ec6d4d4e37ab779d2131839d2b&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)

Too many mistakes, and I enjoyed it.
