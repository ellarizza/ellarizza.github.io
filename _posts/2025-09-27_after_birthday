First, Praise the Lord for the last 26 years of life. 
I have turned 27 yesterday. I want to write what I have in my mind.

Since my birthday in 2024, there were many things that happened. 
I was able to experienced the following: 

## 1. Watched a symphony orchestra
I still remember the chills and mesmerized feeling. It felt like every note is a syllable, and the whole act is a story that I dove in.
Felt like I understand even if I did not hear any words being sang. 

Thanks for visiting!
