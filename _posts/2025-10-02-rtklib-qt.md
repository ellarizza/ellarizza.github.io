title: "Installing RTKLIB Qt in Ubuntu 24"

Today, I learned that RTKLIB GUIs are now available in Linux environment. Thanks to [rtklibexplorer](https://github.com/rtklibexplorer). 
Before I show how to do it, I just want to say that ever since I started using Linux (only Ubuntu because I am a beginner) I have to do either of the following whenever I want to use RTKLIB GUIs:
- use a windows 10 VM; or
- use another laptop

While the first one is manageable, it sometimes is very slow because I don't allot enough computing resources to it. Sometimes, when opening VirtualBox in my PC, it crashes due to some virtualization error(?). The other one is the worse because I have to copy the files from/to the PCs which I still do for .T02/.T04 files. I hope someday Convert2Rinex will have a Linux GUI equivalent. 

Anyway, I'd like to document how to install the RTKLIB Qt in Ubuntu 24. 

### 1. Clone the repository 

```console
username:~$ git clone https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB
```
This command needs `git` to be installed. Alternatively, you can just directly download the `Source Code (zip)` from the [latest release](https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB/releases/tag/v2.5.0)  of this repo. By the way, rtklibexplorer (Mr. Tim Everett) modified RTKLIB for a long time now and is still releasing updates and improvements of original RTKLIB source code. This is very helpful especially that Takasu-san stopped developing RTKLIB few years ago. Just the power of open-source projects. 
According to the readme file of the repo, 
>RTKLIB-EX (previously RTKLIB demo5): A version of RTKLIB optimized for low cost GNSS receivers (single, dual, or triple frequency), especially u-blox receivers and based on RTKLIB 2.4.3.

### 2. Install Qt drivers 

```console
username:~$ sudo apt update
sudo apt install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5serialport5-dev
```
Qt libraries are needed to install the GUIs and get them running. 

### 3. Install RTKLIB GUIs using qmake and make 

```console
username:~$ cd <user_selected_directory>/RTKLIB-2.5.0/app/qtapp
make clean
qmake qtapp.pro
make -j4
```
4 just means four threads are used. You can verify if all GUIs are installed using the following command
```console
username:~$ find . -name "*_qt" -type f -executable
```
and it all went correctly, it should show the following
```console
username:~$ ./rtknavi_qt/rtknavi_qt
./strsvr_qt/strsvr_qt
./rtkconv_qt/rtkconv_qt
./rtkpost_qt/rtkpost_qt
./rtklaunch_qt/rtklaunch_qt
./rtkplot_qt/rtkplot_qt
./srctblbrows_qt/srctblbrows_qt
./rtkget_qt/rtkget_qt
```

This means that the executables are in separately named folders in qtapp folder. At this point you can already run the Qt executables by using either of the following above. For example if i run `./rtklaunch_qt/rtklaunch_qt`, it opens up the RTKLaunch.

### 4. Copy all the executables in one folder. 
Just for convenience, you cant just copy everything into one folder by using the pre-made command. You can just run the command in the terminal
```console
username:~$ ./install_qtapp
```
It will create `RTKLIB_bin` folder which contains all the GUIs and you can execute them from the command line. The folder will be located outside the cloned repository. If you want to change it, you can do so by changing the `$BIN` value in `install_qtapp`. 

### Summary 
That's all. It's fun documenting this. Thanks for the developers for making RTKLIB GUIs available in Linux environment.
