title: "Doing hard things"

tags: [learning]

At the time I was writing this, I was in the middle of reviewing source code for my research and I was stuck. It uses multi-threading and classes which I think I am not very familiar of. I'd like to add a function for my own IMU device, but I don't know how. I don't have the full understanding of the codebase yet. I don't know. 

I should have continued reading and understanding the codebase but my mind can't at the moment. Hence, I am here. Pondering, why do we need to do hard things. Why can't we settle for easy and simple things, after all they are beautiful. But do they really? Why do we need to work hard? Why do we find more fulfillment in doing hard than doing easy? Why society tends to praise the former than the latter? What would happen if we just settle for easy. Is there really anything that is just simple and easy? I came to remember that when I started working for a company after few months, I realized that I don't like the job. Not because it was terrible itself, but because it became too easy and that becoming too easy for me made it terrible in my perspective. Hence, I resigned and looked for a more challenging job. I once thought that I'd like to be challenged everyday, only to disliked being challenged now that I am in that career. Can I still continue doing hard things even if I don't like it? Don't ike in the sense that, it frustrates me when I can't get the results I thought about. What would happen if I just settle for easy? 

**There would be no value**

I guess I don't really expound the title I wrote. Instead, I just ranted. I blew the steam off. Would I get the right approach to my current problem in implementing my idea in the source code? I don't know. The easy part is just to stop right there not knowing. But if I stop, I'll repeat the cycle. 

But if I asked, "am I doing the right approach?". If yes, then I should continue. 
If not, I should admit it was wrong and go back to other choices where it could lead me to the right approach then to the solution hopefully. 
I'll repeat the cycle, but this time, I would get different results until I get the best one. 

Man, I don't know. but I could.
