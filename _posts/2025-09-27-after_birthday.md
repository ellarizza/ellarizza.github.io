First, Praise the Lord for the last 26 years of life. 
I have turned 27 yesterday. I want to write what I have in my mind.

Since my birthday in 2024, there were many things that happened. 
I was able to experienced the following: 

## 1. Watched a symphony orchestra
I still remember the chills and mesmerized feeling. It felt like every note is a syllable, and the whole act is a story that I dove in.
Felt like I understand even if I did not hear any words being sang. 

## 2. Lived in Norway for 2.5 months
I attended an internship in Alesund, Norway. Who would have thought I will be able to go there and meet wonderful people including Ate Rosalinda (my Filipino ate in there). 
This was during the winter, and it was very different from winter in Tokyo. I can feel being depressed just because of the season. But good thing people were very warm, so I eased into it. 
I remember joining a cabin trip with PhD students for 2 days. That was a good one! Also saw the Northern Lights. I also experienced the Norwegian Christmas.

## 3. Traveled around Europe with just a backpack
This was the longest trip I ever did. From Alesund to Amsterdam, I think I traveled for 5 or 6 days continuously. I stayed a night at every city then left the following evening for the next one. 
I went to Oslo, Gothenburg, Copenhagen, Hamburg, and Amsterdam. At the end of my trip, I met my college friends and spent the new year with them in Amsterdam. I still can't get over the smell of weed (never again!).

I will not forget being stranded in a city because of cancelled flights. One was in Amsterdam going back to Alesund because of heavy snow. The other was in Warsaw because of late arrival of connecting flight. 
That was 2 almost consecutive days, I thought I would be getting another one and that would be a strike.

## 4. Went to Los Angeles and Phuket for a conference
It was for ITM conference. Conference was a little intimate, less people, less exhibit which I also enjoy. After the conference, I went to LA downtown to visit Staples Center and see Kobe Bryant's Statue.
But then, I have to commute. That was an interesting commute experience, I am not used being stared whenever I ride a bus. I guess I am used in commute in Japan where people won't care a thing. 

MGA conference was held in Phuket, Thailand. I ate Pad Thai every day!! I guess I was also active in asking questions during this conference. 

## 5. Master's Graduation and Family in Tokyo
Yes!!! The most awaited yet unexciting day. Finally finished my master's after 2 years. Man, that was quick. My family attended. Was tired during those days, but I hope I was able to accompany them and make memories with them in their first trip to Japan. 

## 6. ION GNSS+ 2025 in Baltimore
This is interesting, because I only flew by myself. I was able to have one free day and visited Washington DC. I realized how very Christian were the founding fathers which are completely opposite to the America that I came to know. 
In this conference, networking-wise it was very active as well. I received couple of questions during my presentation. Talked with new people for the first time, even those people who invited me to check their job opportunities (Hey, Apple). 
Oh, this is also interesting because on my way to Tokyo, I had a good 3 hour remaining flight. I met and talked with a guy seating beside me. His first time in Tokyo. Talked for a while. When we landed, I took the first move and said he was cute.
But we did not exchange contact, and it ended that way. 

After writing these things, I realized my life was not boring at all. It was full of exciting and unexciting yet fulfilling events. Meeting and chatting with people are things I thought I already stopped doing. 
But as a human, that's part of me. always a part of me because I am social being. In trips that I thought I would feel more alone because I was by myself, that's when I felt I was more surrounded by people. 
Dating wise, I guess it will be still a continuous journey in this new year. I was reminded that I don't have to lower the standards and live the standards that I am expecting from the guy. 
Honestly, I thought dating would be easy. I was wrong. If it's easy, then it's not worth it. And I am humbled by that. 

Lastly, nothing is more important than remembering the faithfulness of my Lord and Saviour, Jesus of Nazareth. He was, is, and will always be faithful to us. I need to always remember that. 
To live with that in my mind always no matter what the situation is. I know and I have mroe than enough proof to trust in Him even in times that I don't feel like it. This life is not for me anymore.
This life is for the glory of Jesus. That in all aspects of my life, He must be known by everyone around me. 

Man, what a time to be alive. what a time to be a Christian. I am grateful. 

This was good. very good. I should write more often.
