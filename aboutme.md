---

My full name is Ellarizza Fredeluces, but people call me Ella. 
- am a Christian. I follow Jesus Christ of Nazareth which means my life is patterned after His teachings and examples. Which also means I am not perfect, but a work in progress.
- love my people. I show this by making time with them and be with them in the moment.
- likes learning different stuff.
- currently doing my PhD in Tokyo, Japan. 

### The question above

To be honest, I don't have any convincing answer. But if you would like to engage in whatever I post in this site, please feel free to do so in the comment section. 
I just really want to document my life without using social media. Something to look back years from now. 
If any of current and future posts help you, that would be great.
